# RISC-V-Pipeline-Processor
This project implements a 32-bit pipelined RISC processor in SystemVerilog, designed as part of a self-driven learning initiative. The processor supports a 5-stage pipeline — Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, and Write Back — with modules for hazard detection, data forwarding, and branch control.
